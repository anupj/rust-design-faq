# Introduction

So, you're coming from C++ and want to write Rust? Great!

You have questions? We have answers.

This book is a collection of frequently asked questions for those arriving from existing C++ codebases. It guides you on how to adapt your C++ thinking to the new facilities available in Rust. It should help you if you're coming from other big object-oriented languages such as Java too.

Although it's structured as questions and answers, it can also be read front-to-back, to give you hints about how to adapt your C++/Java thinking to a more idiomatically Rusty approach.

It does not aim to teach you Rust - there are many better resources. It doesn't aim to talk about Rust idioms _in general_ - [there are existing guides for that](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/idioms/index.html) - but when transitioning from some other traditionally OO language, you'll have questions about how to achieve the same outcomes in idiomatic Rust. That's what this guide is for.

# Structure

The guide starts with idioms at the small scale - answering questions about how you'd write a few lines of code - and moves towards ever larger patterns - answering questions about how you'd structure your whole codebase.
